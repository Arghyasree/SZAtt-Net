# SZAtt-Net: A Unified Deep Learning Model with Attention Mechanisms for Schizophrenia Classification

## Overview

Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex psychiatric disorder characterized by delusions, perceptual disturbances, cognitive impairments, and neurocognitive deficits. Its heterogeneous nature—varying in severity, progression, and treatment response—presents significant diagnostic challenges. To address these challenges, neuroimaging techniques such as EEG (offering high temporal resolution) and MRI (providing detailed structural and functional insights) play a crucial role in understanding neural dysfunction in SZ.

Advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches have been developed to enhance SZ detection, facilitating early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes. This study introduces **SZAtt-Net**, a novel deep learning framework that integrates **Conv2D, BiGRU, and Attention Mechanisms** to classify schizophrenia using EEG and MRI data.


**Performance Evaluation:** The model was tested on three benchmark SZ datasets:
  - **Kaggle EEG Dataset**: Achieved **99.37% accuracy**
  - **LMSU EEG Dataset**: Achieved **98.92% accuracy**
  - **Hippocampus MRI Dataset**: Achieved **96.33% accuracy**

## Key Contributions

- **Unified Multimodal Framework:** SZAtt-Net effectively processes both EEG and MRI data for schizophrenia classification.
- **Enhanced Feature Extraction:** Comparative analysis of attention mechanisms demonstrates the model’s effectiveness in capturing spatiotemporal patterns.
- **First Implementation of SZ Classification Using MRI:** This study pioneers the use of MRI-based deep learning models for schizophrenia detection.
- **Clinical Relevance:** Provides a foundation for more accessible and accurate diagnostic solutions in psychiatric research.

## Future Directions

- Exploring hybrid models combining EEG and MRI for improved classification.
- Expanding dataset diversity for better generalization.
- Integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance interpretability in clinical applications.
